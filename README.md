## Overview
This is a website intended to represent Edsger dijkstra

Iâ€™ve tried to make it as responsive as possible for both mobile and desktop devices. for instance, i wrapped the facebook like button in a div and limited its width. I noticed that not doing it overflowed the website box model and allowed the user to scroll to the blank space on the right side of the website.
Elso i stylized the menu so it will appear smalller on mobile, and created a script that will offset the href on screens with width smaller than 600 so the menu will not block the sections title on the page.
